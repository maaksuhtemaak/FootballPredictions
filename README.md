Data files: combineddata.csv, season-1819_csv.csv, seasons-1314-1718.csv 
These consists all the files needed to run the files - combineddata has all the seasons, others have testing and training data, 18-19 season for testing and the 4 seasons prior to that for training.

Correlations.ipynb file is for calculating correlations for everything, the code is commented. 

Project.ipynb file is for predicting scores and has many tried models in it, code itself is commented and could easily be used. 

There are also poster sample and a pdf with the main ideas and objectives, and one Excel file where we found the correlations between certain teams and made some assumptions with that.
